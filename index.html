    <h1>The A and I Story</h1>
      <p>
              Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
              Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
              sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
              <strong><<em>at least a billion people</em></strong>, and probably more.
            </p>

                  In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
                  Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
                </p>

                <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #FEFEFE;">
                  <p>
                    <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
                    <br>
                    â€”Abraham Lincoln
                  </p>

    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the

        <h2>Founders</h2>

            <p>
              Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
              Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
              <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
              introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
              <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
              plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
              are slightly exaggerated.

        <h3>Yendry Mora</h3>

            <p>
              When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
              on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
              interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
              interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.
            </p>

        <p>
      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
      at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
